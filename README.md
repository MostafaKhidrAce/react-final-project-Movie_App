## Functionality

### Data Source
- We use the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://api.themoviedb.org/3) to fetch information about trending movies, TV shows, and people.

### Main Features
1. **Trending Lists Display**: The application fetches daily trending lists using the TMDb API and displays them on the webpage. It includes movies, TV shows, and people.

2. **Filtering**: You can filter the trending lists locally by media type (movie, TV show, person). This allows you to view specific types of trending items.

3. **Searching**: You can search for movies, TV shows, and people using the server-side filtration feature provided by the TMDb API.

4. **Details Page**: Clicking on an item in the trending lists takes you to a details page, which displays comprehensive information about the item. The details page uses the TMDb API to fetch data.

5. **Image Display**: The application displays images using TMDb's image base URLs for "poster_path" and "backdrop_path."
